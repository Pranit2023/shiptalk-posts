        "content": "Hi r/Logistics\n\nI consult for an organization that is looking for a US customs broker that can handle T86 entries for ecommerce for goods that cross the northern border by truck. Entry volume per day is around 5,000, increasing at peak. They ship six days a week, year round. Only a portion of these daily entries are on the table for this opportunity, but it is a permanent opportunity, and the percentage of entries to be filed as T86 will probably increase as regulatory ramps up in the US.\n\nThey're an experienced ecommerce 3PL with a stable client and commodity base. The client themselves holds all required FDA, Health Canada and other licenses or registrations. *This is not a marketplace like TEMU etc.* The clients have a mix of non-regulated and regulated products. Food, Dietary Supplements, general consumer household goods etc. COO is mixed but mostly COO US, Canada or China. These are currently cleared with a mix of S321, T86, informal and formal entries depending on the situation. They're looking for aggressive pricing from a broker well experienced in ecommerce that can handle mass submissions of entries (Excel template upload or API/EDI).\n\nThey're very savvy on compliance and IT fronts. The commodities don't change frequently - these are well known brands and products with long product lifecycles - again, this is *not* a marketplace. These are de minimis imports of the same product day in, day out, each to a new consignee.\n\nDesired launch date is ASAP - they could start sending entries as soon as next week if the right partner is found.\n\nThey are looking to speak only with brokers who are well experienced with ecommerce T86. The daily trucking could be on the table in the future as well depending on the partner. This is potentially a multi-million dollar per year account for a brokerage / forwarder with the right service and product lineup. DM me for more detail and if you think you have a solution.",

We sold everything in 2022, and I took an accounting manager position at a 3PL company.\n\nThe 3PL company I currently work for has 4 warehouses spread out along the East Coast, plus a trucking company. Most of our trucking is for draying containers from the ports to store in our warehouses. I also help manage a new sugar import business alongside one of the C-suite officers. We import sugar from overseas and resell it by the metric ton in the U.S. My role is mainly focused on costing and accounting.\n\nWhile I'm good at accounting, I don\u2019t really enjoy it and don\u2019t see much of a future at the small company I\u2019m at now. I\u2019ve been hearing a lot about SC being a good field to get into, and that my accounting, operations management, and procurement skills would transfer well. But I haven\u2019t had much luck with my applications over the past few months.\n\nRecently, I landed an interview for a buyer position at a major food distributor here in the Philly area. I\u2019m looking for advice on how to frame my experience for this role. I feel like I might be a bit overqualified, but it's a large company, so I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll be able to grow there. Does anyone have any advice or warnings? The Glassdoor salary range for a buyer at this company is $55k-90k. I\u2019m aiming for $75-80k\u2014does that sound realistic?",

I have gotten to a stage in my career where it has become evident that I need a better understanding of inventory management, specifically, understanding how much to buy of certain items year after year after generating sales data. \n\nThe specific predicament I\u2019m in is I am ill-equipped to do. We have a large planning team in charge of establishing Open-To-Buys/Forecasts, but when it comes to me determining optimal inventory levels of specific *products*, I am at a loss. \n\nCan someone point me in the direction of a good online course to learn more and figure this out? Free or paid, either works.\n\nThanks! ",

To really understand everything you want to know, you really do need a degree; you're not going to learn statistics and stochastic simulation and newsvendor models and all the other necessary context from just one course. \n\nHowever, if you only had to understand one thing, you would need to understand how to calculate a re-order point and how to work with that.\n\nIf you're not an expert in data science/forecasting/ML/statistics, you would want to get with someone who is (i.e. in the planning team), and then get them to design a solution to calculate your re-order point (\"ROP\").  That is the minimum \"floor\" of inventory you have, at which point you trigger a replenishment order.\n\nIf your lead time for replenishment (i.e. the time between the point at which you press the \"re-order\" button and the time you receive that replenishment order) is short, then you are in luck and you might be able to greatly simplify this.  If your lead time for replenishment is lengthy or highly variable, you would generally want to use a stochastic simulation to calculate your \"optimal inventory level\" for a *specific product*, which is what you said you wanted to know how to do.\n\nThe way you want to set a re-order point is to calculate the joint conditional probability distribution of the lead time and the demand forecast, and then optimize that according to your desired \"Cycle Service Level\" or CSL.  If your CSL is 90%, then you are trying to set an inventory level that will permit you to remain in stock on that product at least 90% of the time.  You can play with the value to be more or less aggressive.\n\nSkipping over a lot of other details here \u2014 you should lean on your planning and forecasting team about these \u2014 once you have an optimal ROP for each Sku of interest, then you trigger a replenishment order whenever you are at or below the ROP (or close to it).  This is how you manage.\n\nActually implementing this in practice is non-trivial to do, but it can be done.  I have done this for my small wine importing company.  We have long and highly variable lead times and highly seasonal demand for our core products, so the ROP changes as we move through time, according to seasonality.  Honestly, it's easier to manage these things when you can just do it all yourself sometimes \u2014 otherwise you need to coordinate the efforts of a large team, which can sometimes be costly and can eat up budget if you're not careful.",

Depending on your industry, you may or may not have lot expiration dates/shelf life to think about. Based on your lead times, you\u2019ll generate your reorder point. After that, you need to decide how many days or weeks you feel comfortable having on hand. If you have a high moving item or material that you know has 2 week lead time, then having 3 weeks of inventory might not hurt you. \n\nLook at your suppliers reliability as well. If they\u2019re always shipping on time and in full then you can asume you\u2019ll be ok should you run a bit lean during a peak period or promotion. However, if they\u2019re shorting you and have supply issues, you know to stock up a bit. Safety stock levels will be more important here.",
