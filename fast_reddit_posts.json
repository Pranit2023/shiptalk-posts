        "content": "Hi r/Logistics\n\nI consult for an organization that is looking for a US customs broker that can handle T86 entries for ecommerce for goods that cross the northern border by truck. Entry volume per day is around 5,000, increasing at peak. They ship six days a week, year round. Only a portion of these daily entries are on the table for this opportunity, but it is a permanent opportunity, and the percentage of entries to be filed as T86 will probably increase as regulatory ramps up in the US.\n\nThey're an experienced ecommerce 3PL with a stable client and commodity base. The client themselves holds all required FDA, Health Canada and other licenses or registrations. *This is not a marketplace like TEMU etc.* The clients have a mix of non-regulated and regulated products. Food, Dietary Supplements, general consumer household goods etc. COO is mixed but mostly COO US, Canada or China. These are currently cleared with a mix of S321, T86, informal and formal entries depending on the situation. They're looking for aggressive pricing from a broker well experienced in ecommerce that can handle mass submissions of entries (Excel template upload or API/EDI).\n\nThey're very savvy on compliance and IT fronts. The commodities don't change frequently - these are well known brands and products with long product lifecycles - again, this is *not* a marketplace. These are de minimis imports of the same product day in, day out, each to a new consignee.\n\nDesired launch date is ASAP - they could start sending entries as soon as next week if the right partner is found.\n\nThey are looking to speak only with brokers who are well experienced with ecommerce T86. The daily trucking could be on the table in the future as well depending on the partner. This is potentially a multi-million dollar per year account for a brokerage / forwarder with the right service and product lineup. DM me for more detail and if you think you have a solution.",

Because of this, our team is under a lot of pressure tackling unnecessary issues on an everyday basis.\n\n The corporate cannot replace the system since its been used by other locations as well. \n\nBut however, I was wondering if I could integrate an API between the inhouse system that we have and a modern warehouse management system, that could talk to each other and reconcile information.\n\nAlso, we already have a lot of equipment like multiple handheld mobile scanners running on android, barcode printers, wearable barcode scanners which was ordered by a previous employee but never used because the equipment cannot be integrated with the inhouse system that we have.\n\nPlease suggest me the best way to tackle this, and I would appreciate if anybody could suggest me a good warehouse management/ inventory tracking software to integrate all of the equipment.\n\n  \nThanks and Regards.\n\n",

Likewise you might connect subsystems on top of your WMS for controlling conveyors, voice picking etc.  If your base system is good enough, you could get someone in to assess and quote a voice system or similar to go on top.  All this tends to cost alot, so .. your scale and the size of the problem itself will determine whether it is worth the effort.  A half assed implementation is often worse than doing nothing.",

With so much happening in logistics and the global economy, we wanted to explore how consumer preferences around sustainability are influencing the last-mile delivery space.\n\n* **57% of consumers** are interested in sustainable home delivery options.\n* A staggering **99%** are open to doing more to reduce their carbon footprint.\n* **89%** said economic pressures, like inflation, affect whether they can afford to pay extra for eco-friendly delivery.\n* **37%** now weigh **convenience** and **sustainability** equally when choosing delivery options.\n\nOne notable trend is the rise of **green delivery slots**, where multiple orders are bundled into fewer trips to cut emissions and reduce costs. **56%** of respondents are ready to adopt this practice. For last-mile providers, this could be a key innovation to not only help the environment but also manage operational costs more effectively.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take? How is the last-mile space adapting to meet sustainability goals while dealing with cost constraints? Any new tech or processes helping you balance both?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts! \ud83d\ude4c If you\u2019re interested in diving deeper into the full study, you can check it out here:  \n[https://engage.descartes.com/descartes-insights/featured/2024-home-delivery-sustainability-the-environmentally-conscious-consumer-under-pressure](https://engage.descartes.com/descartes-insights/featured/2024-home-delivery-sustainability-the-environmentally-conscious-consumer-under-pressure)",

        "content": "I wanted to share my experience in the logistics field, hoping it might help those considering this career path. I've worked on both the 3PL/freight brokerage side and the customer side, and it's been quite a ride.\n\nWorking as an account coordinator at a 3PL is intense. The volume of emails and last-minute issues is overwhelming. While larger 3PLs offer some work-life balance with specific departments handling after-hours issues, smaller brokerages expect you to be available almost 24/7. I made around $64K, but the constant stress and off-hours calls were exhausting.\n\nBeing a logistics specialist on the customer side is less stressful. I've worked for smaller companies, and the volume was manageable. I rarely had to stay late or deal with off-hours issues. However, the pay was lower, around $45-$55K. While it's a more relaxed role, it doesn\u2019t come close to the $100K salary range I'm aiming for without moving into a scarce managerial position.\n\nI\u2019ve also tried customs clearance, which is similar to domestic logistics with constant updates and issues. The financial rewards aren\u2019t much better.\n\nOverall, logistics is a tough, undervalued industry, and the pay reflects that. It's challenging to find a role that pays well without demanding excessive hours. For those considering this field, be aware of the demanding nature and limited financial upside.\n\n",

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI work for a mid-size property management company in the NE US.  We have a warehouse that we have built at our new office property, and we hold all inventory for the maintenance and HVAC teams within this warehouse.  This includes appliances for unit upgrades and turns.  We have no inventory management system, except a person with a spreadsheet but no way to track who is taking what, or where it ends up.  I'd like to implement a QR based system that would allow for items to be scanned when removed from the warehouse (showing who is taking it, and that it is no longer part of 'warehouse inventory'), then scanned when installed at the appropriate property (adding to the property 'in-use inventory').  I'd like each of our maintenace team members to have individual access to this system so that inventory is tied to the person.  I'd like to be able to generate inventory reports that will inform our purchasing agent what we need.  \n\nI'm not sure if QR is the best path forward, but it's what we've come up with in a brainstorming session.  I imagine something like this, or close to this at the very least, exists already, but I'm not finding anything that isn't related to retail inventory management, or if it is maintenance focused is filled with work order management and other features we don't need because they're covered in our PMS.  Anywhere you good people can point me is appreciated!\n\n  \nThanks",

Then you can easily view a report of equipment by location. \n\nWhether you use QR or barcodes doesn't really matter. You need to ensure that your inventory is tracked when it comes into the warehouse, and that whoever decides which equipment shall go to which job enters a ticket of some sort -- whether its a transfer or a sale.",
